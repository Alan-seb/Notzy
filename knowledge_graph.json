      "text": "Memory allocation functions – malloc, calloc Malloc Memory allocation functions There are 4 library functions provided by C defined under <stdlib.h> header file to facilitate dynamic memory allocation in C programming. They are:\n· malloc() · calloc() · free() · realloc() malloc():\n“malloc” or “memory allocation” method in C is used to dynamically allocate a single large block of memory with the specified size. It returns a pointer of type void which can be cast into a pointer of any form.\nSyntax:\nptr = (cast-type*) malloc(byte-size) For Example:\nptr = (int*) malloc(100 * sizeof(int));\nSince the size of int is 4 bytes, this statement will allocate 400 bytes of memory. And, the pointer ptr holds the address of the first byte in the allocated memory.\nmalloc(): example #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> int main() { int* ptr;\nint n=5, i, sum = 0;\nptr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));\nfor (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { ptr[i] = i + 1;\nprintf(\"The elements of the array are: \");\nfor (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { printf(\"%d, \", ptr[i]);\nreturn 0;\nThis is DC for C"

      "text": "UNIT II Searching Techniques Searching is the process of looking through the data contained in a data structure and determining if a specific value is present. (And potentially returning it.) The contains methods of the ArrayList, for example, is a method that searches the list for a given value and returns true of false.\n1. Linear Search The most basic search algorithm is a linear search. This is just a fancy name for “start at the first element and go through the list until you find what you are looking for.” It is the simplest search.\nHere is a simple implementation for an array:\npublic static int linearSearch(int[] a, int value) { int n = a.length;\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { if (a[i] == value) return i;\nreturn -1;\nIf you look carefully at it, you’ll realize that the efficiency is O(N). Is it possible to do better than this, though?\n2. Binary Search Binary search is a searching algorithm that is faster than O(N). It has a catch, though: It requires the array you are searching to already be sorted. If you have a sorted array, then you can search it as follows:\n1. Imagine you are searching for element v.\n2. Start at the middle of the array. Is v smaller or larger than the middle element? If smaller, then do the algorithm again on the left half of the array. If larger, then do the algorithm again on the right half of the array.\nBasically, with every step, we cut the number of elements we are searching for in half. Here is a simple implementation:\npublic static int binarySearch(int[] a, int value) { int lowIndex = 0;\nint highIndex = a.length - 1;\nwhile (lowIndex <= highIndex) { int midIndex = (lowIndex + highIndex) / 2;\nif (value < a[midIndex]) highIndex = midIndex - 1;\nelse if (value > a[midIndex]) lowIndex = midIndex + 1;\nelse // found it!\nreturn midIndex;\nreturn -1; // The value doesn't exist The efficiency of this is more complicated than the things we’ve been analyzing so far. We aren’t doing N work in the worst case, because even in the worst case we are cutting the array in half each step. When an algorithm cuts the data in half at each step, that efficiency is logarithmic. In this case, O(log2 N)). In efficiency, we frequently drop the base 2 from logarithmic efficiency, so we can just write this as O(log N) This is significantly better than an O(N) algorithm."

      "text": "Linear / Sequential Search Linear search is also called as sequential search algorithm. It is the simplest searching algorithm. In Linear search, we simply traverse the list completely and match each element of the list with the item whose location is to be found. If the match is found, then the location of the item is returned; otherwise, the algorithm returns NULL.\nIt is the simplest of all the searching techniques which does not expect the specific ordering of data.\nSequential search is nothing but searching an element / record in a linear way. This can be in arrays or in linked lists.\nLinear search algorithm finds a given element on a list of elements with O( n ) time complexity where n is the total number of elements in the lists. Start the search from the beginning by comparing the ‘key’ in each case and by scanning all the elements one by one until the end of the array or the linked list. If search is successful, the entire record of that particular ‘key’ or the index of the record or the pointer to the record is returned. If the search is unsuccessful, it gives a failure notification ‘-1’ is returned.\nLinear search is implemented using the following steps Step 1: Read the search element (key).\nStep 2: Compare the search element with the first element in the list.\nStep 3: If both are matched, then display search element is found and terminate the function.\nStep 4: If both are not matched, then compare search element with the next element in the list Step 5: Repeat the Steps 3 & 4 until the search element is compared with the last element in the list.\nStep 6: If the last element in the list does not match, then display element not found and terminate the function.\nAlgorithm: Linear Search Algorithm: Linear Search (list [ ], n, key) Let list [ ] be a linear array with n elements and key is an element to be searched in the list Step 1: Set i = 0 Step 2: while (i < n) do If list [i] == key then return i; //Key found at ith location end while Step 3: return -1; //key not found Example - Linear Search Consider the following list of elements and element to be searched:\nSearch element (Key): 12 Step 1: Search element 12 is compared with the first element 65 Step 2: Search element 12 is compared with the next element 20 Step 3: Search element 12 is compared with the next element 10 Step 4: Search element 12 is compared with the next element 55 Step 5: Search element 12 is compared with the next element 32 Step 6: Search element 12 is compared with the next element 12 Both are matching, so move to the next element. Terminate the function and display the element found at index ‘5’."
